    Structure:      - Everything is well organized and well labeled, making looking through the 
                      files easier.
                    - Great use of header files for the implementation!

    Functionality:  - Took a second to figure out how to run the code bbut otherwise easy to use.
                    - Action 2 seemed to be hardcodded for a specific user but did show the 
                      correct posts.
                    -
    
    Comments:       - Great use of comments throughout to explain your process.
                    - The code was easy to read through and understand.
